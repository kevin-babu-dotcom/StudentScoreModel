## Introduction

This project is focused on building a linear regression model to predict student performance based on the hours studied. The model was developed using Python and Flask and is intended to serve as a practical demonstration of my skills in data science and machine learning.

## Dataset

## Model Overview

The model was built using the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle's Student Study Hours Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himanshunakrani/student-study-hours).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data was cleaned and prepared for modeling.
3. **Modeling**: A linear regression model was trained to predict student scores.
4. **Deployment**: The model was deployed as a web application using Flask.
5. **Evaluation**: The model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and RÂ² score.

### Key Features

- **Simple and Intuitive**: Easy-to-understand linear regression model.
- **Web Interface**: Users can input study hours through a web interface and receive predicted scores.
- **Educational**: Aimed at beginners looking to understand basic machine learning concepts and web development using Flask.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   
       git clone https://github.com/kevin-babu-dotcom/StudentScoreModel.git
2. Navigate to the repository
   
       cd StudentScoreModel
3. Install the required dependencies:

        pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

         python -m venv venv
         venv\Scripts\activate`
5. Install the required dependencies:
        
        pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage

To use the model, follow these steps:

1. Run the Flask Application: Make sure you are in the project directory, then run:

        python app.py
2. Access the Web Application: Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

3. Input Study Hours: On the web page, enter the number of study hours in the input field and submit the form to get the predicted score.
